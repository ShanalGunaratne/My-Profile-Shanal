				<h2>About Myself</h2>
				<h5>Student <span>& Aspiring Developer</span></h5>
				<p>Hello everyone, my name is Hashitha Shanal Gunaratne, but you can call me Shane. I was born on a small island called Sri Lanka, the Pearl of the Indian Ocean. If you have never heard of it before you can find my little island nation right below India. My Nationality is Sri Lankan, and our culture is influenced by its Buddhist heritage, however, it is home to many other religions therefore it is multicultural, and with age, it has become a fusion of different traditions.
				</p>
				<p>Something you might find interesting about me is that I have a hobby that I inherited from my grandfather, his coin collection which I will force myself to continue. I also play basketball, read novels, and study photography. Currently, I am passionate about programming, and after wasting some time worrying about what language to choose, I have finally started my new journey with python. After the basics I am excited to see what I can create with it.

      <h2>My <span>Interest in IT</span>  </h2>
      <h5>When, why, and what is your interest in IT? </h5>
      <p>I became extremely interested in programming during COVID-19. While I was quarantined, I applied to a free scholarship program and had a wonderful time coding and building a robotic car. After this experience I wanted to learn more, so I started to research and finally decided to study IT. During my research, I gravitated toward the application development side of IT. Being able to analyze situations and create different applications to solve problems was very attractive. Also, software developers work on different projects that integrate different industries, this will allow me to work with people from different occupations.  No only have I seen more opportunities for growth and creation in this sector, the number of new jobs and pay has been rising in recent years.</p>
      <p></p>

      <h5>Why Did You Choose to Come to RMIT?   </h5>
      <p>Starting to study a completely new subject was very daunting, and I needed the proper environment to learn and develop the necessary skills to pursue my goal. RMIT contains what I need. Firstly, the program's modules integrate both practical and theoretical knowledge in a working context which I think is the most valuable. Secondly, I think the program's modular structure is intriguing. It is flexible and can be customized to my needs.  (RMIT University, 2022) </p>

      <h5>What Do You Expect to Learn During Your Studies?  </h5>
      <p>For the Bachelor of Information Technology program, I will focus my 8 electives on software development and my 4 minor subjects on networking. This will allow me access to more opportunities to gain a distinct and unique insight into the development of efficient applications. By completing this, I expect to gain the necessary skills to start my career in the field of IT. For example, working in group assignments will give me the opportunity to develop teamwork skills. Another example is  from this course, where I will learn the fundamentals of GitHub, HTML, and CSS which are the technical skills needed. (RMIT University, 2022) </p>

    <h2>My <span>Personal Profile </span>  </h2>
    <img src="16 personality test.png">
    <img src="learning styles.png">
    <img src="Test My Creativity.png">

    <h5>What Do the Results of These Tests Mean for You?</h5>
    <p>After taking the tests I found the results to be very informative and will be very helpful for my development.  Starting with Myers-Briggs 16 personalities test results (16Personalities, 2022), I was able to identify myself better. I learned about my strengths and my weaknesses. This knowledge can be used to develop myself and grow further.  For example, the results indicate that I am more prone to struggle with taking steps to achieve my goals even though I have the skills and passion for it. I struggle with this personally and have now learned to take one ordinary, manageable step at a time rather than worrying about the big picture.</p>

       <p>Next, I tested my learning style. This provided me with a result indicating that I am a visual learner. I learn through a mix of visual and auditory learning. This test has provided 25% for auditory and 50% for visual so I cannot say this test is inaccurate as it matches the style I practice. (EducationPlanner.org, 2022) Also, the learning style test has opened my mind to the possibility of incorporating a tactical approach to the way I study. The last test was uncertain as the questions were vague and uncertain. However, I learned about the parameters for creativity, therefore I know how to work on my creative side. For example, practicing the connection parameter will force me to make connections or links to different ideas and knowledge. This will allow me to develop my thoughts and ideas to another level. (testmycreativity, 2022)  </p>

    <h5>How Do You Think These Results May Influence Your Behavior in A Team? </h5>
    <p>The concepts I have learned will be very useful when dealing with a team, as they will allow me to interact and understand them better. For example, the Myers-Briggs test will allow me to identify my weak points when it comes to teamwork. The fact that I am more introverted will affect my interaction with my team. Therefore, I will need to use my strengths to help my team members and make sure to interact with them adequately.  It is the same for the other test, for example, I will need to focus on listening to my members deeply just as much as I see them interact. This will allow me to understand them better. The creativity test will show where I lack in certain team tasks, which will allow me to ask for help beforehand to reduce the risk of failure.  </p>

    <h5>How Should You Take This into Account When Forming A Team? </h5>
    <p>My test results will be considered when forming a team, mainly when accepting or selecting members that can fill the skills or talents I lack. This method will strengthen my team and me for any possible task we come across. However, these results are not the only thing that should be taken into account when forming teams. For example, there may be people that are more extroverted than me that can also have a very aggressive personality that can destroy the team dynamics. </p>

<!--Project Idea---->
<section class="about">
<div class="main1">
  <div class="about-text1">
    <h2>My <span>Project Idea</span>  </h2>

    <h5>Project: <span>Overview</span></h5>
    <p>My project will be an application called the "Fuel Limit" that will be able to ration and allocate appropriate amounts of petroleum to the population of a country. Simply, it will record a citizen's consumption of petrol and make sure everyone keeps to their limit. Firstly, every citizen will be allowed to register and access an account that will provide them with information about their petrol usage. Then they will be able to use their mobile app or barcode to purchase their allocated ration. Anyone that cannot access the mobile application will be allowed to access the system with their national identity card at the gas station. This is made for the government to regulate and support the economy.  </p>

    <h5>Project: <span>Motivation</span></h5>
    <p>Currently, my country Sri Lanka is going through an economic crisis and is running out of essential things such as electricity, petroleum, medicine, and many more. One of the most problematic things during this time is fuel queues. These queues are growing longer every day, and some have created new queues next to the old ones, shutting down roads and increasing traffic. People are now getting angry and frustrated, leading to fights with gas station employees and law enforcement. However, the most worrying thing is that people have started to steal from others by harming vehicles, leading to many accidents and extremely dangerous situations. My application "Fuel Limit " will be able to ration every citizen's usage accordingly and lawfully stop any dangerous activity.  </p>

    <h5>Project: <span>Description</span></h5>
    <p>Fuel Limit will be accessible as a website or as a mobile application. First, the user will need to register to the application using their vehicle registration number, chassis number, number plate and other essential information required by the Motor Traffic Department. Once the user's identity has been verified, he will be allowed a quota on a weekly basis. If the user has any problems with the quota, they will need to lodge an application explaining why they should be given a higher limit. For example, if the users are ambulance drivers, they will be allowed a higher limit. According to users’ requirements and if their application need is seen as essential, their weekly quotas will be increased.   </p>
      <p>Once a user's limit is decided, they will be able to purchase petrol at gas stations. The purchasing process can be carried out in two ways. Users will be able to load a QR (quick response) code that will be scanned by the gas station worker. Once the user's details are verified, they will be able to access their given ration of petrol. In addition to QR codes, users are given the option of using Bluetooth beacons and NFC tags. To use the NFC tag the user needs to bring their device and tap the scanner and the Bluetooth beacon will allow the scanner to access the user's data as long as they are near to them. These options will allow users to stay safe from COVID-19. Once the purchase is made the system will update the purchase in the system. The second purchasing process is created when a customer does not have a smartphone. May it be they do not own one or forgot to bring it, they will have to go through a long process to verify their identity and current usage. The gas station worker will ask for their national identity number and the pin number given during registration.  </p>
        <p>The gas station employee will also be able to access the system to regulate the quantity of fuel in storage. They will be given a scanner that will scan QR codes, detect NFC tags and receive signals from a Bluetooth beacon. After the scan, they will be able to access the remaining usage of the customer. Then they will refuel the vehicle accordingly and update the system. Once the system updates the customer usage, after it is reduced, it will not change until the next week.  </p>
          <p>It will also include normal features like push notifications and important news regarding fuel from the government, security to access the application, speed, and simplicity. It also has a function to derive feedback and depending on the needs, the updates will be created. This application not only provides a service to the customers but also the country's management. The government will be able to access the overall usage of petrol by its citizens. This data will be useful in multiple ways. For example, with real-total usage, the next shipment can be calculated and ordered faster.  </p>

    <h5>Project: <span>Tools and Technologies</span></h5>
    <p>For this application, a few languages will be used. SQL, as it involves government data from all its citizens. Next, we will use the open-source software called Flutter to allow android and IOS users to access the application. In order to facilitate the purchasing options, such as the NFC tags, QR codes and Bluetooth beacons, a proper scanner must be used. This scanner needs to be small and somewhat portable.  </p>

    <h5>Project: <span>Skills Required</span>  </h5>
    <p>First, we need to write and create the application using Flutter and SQL. To do this we need a team of software developers that can work with the government to create a unique product for the country. One of the main issues will be to get the agreement of the government. Once acceptance is granted, we can create the application by working together with the government. After the software is created, we will need a QR scanner that will need to be remodeled with NFC tags and Bluetooth beacon acceptance hardware. If we are able to get the agreement of the government, the ability and resources to create this application will also be solved.  </p>

    <h5>Project: <span>Outcome</span></h5>
    <p>If this application is built and implemented, we will not see any large queues or congested roads. We will be able to put a stop to the destruction of property and illegal extra consumption and selling of petrol. Every citizen will be allowed the bare minimum of what they need to carry out their work and daily activities. Users will be able to go back to their previous schedules, and economic activity and productivity will start to move again, which in turn will help the economy. The government will be able to order the next shipment more accurately and will be able to focus its resources on other economic issues. </p>
